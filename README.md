# Annotated-basic-tasks

This battery contains tasks assessing various kinds of affordances. Three main folders pertain to general precondition tasks, main tasks and generalisation tasks. 

Battery structure: 

General precondition tasks: this folder contains tasks that are testing for various prerequisite capabilities that appear in the majority of tasks in the Main tasks. 
Main tasks: this folder contains several subfolders where each subfolder contains tasks tapping into one type of affordance (e.g., climbability). 
Within these subfolders there are additional subfolders testing for affordances related to different objects (e.g., ramp vs. wall stairs). 
And subfolders within these subfolders represent different paradigms that tap into the same affordance (e.g., ramp box). 
--> Some folders also contain a subfolder with prerequisite tasks (e.g., ramp preconditions): these prerequisites are specific to paradigms in whose subfolders they appear. 
Generalisation tasks: tasks in this folder test for some of the same affordances as tasks in the Main tasks subfolder, however different objects are used to tap into the same affordance. 
These tasks test whether agents can perform functional generalisation, i.e., whether they recognise that different objects can afford the same functionality. 
For example, if the agent sees a thin wall tilted over another wall brick such that it affords climbing, the agent should be able to realise that this construction can be used in the same way as ramps.  

Task naming convention: 

Each task begins with the name of the main folder it belongs to, e.g., _main. 
The second part of the name is unique and refers to the paradigm name, sometimes followed by extension _left or _right, depending on whether the paradigm has a left and a right paradigm. 
Following is an extension _Cn, which refers to the complexity of a paradigm. 
Complexity is determined relative to other tasks in a subfolder testing for an object specific affordance type. Complexity goes from 1 (the easiest) to 4 (the hardest). 
Following is an extension _FC, which denotes whether a particular task is a forced choice task (1) or not (0).
