     # GOODGOAL AND MULTIGOODGOALS CHANGE INDEPENDENT IN SIZE. FOR EACH COMBINATION I NEED TO SPECIFY PASS MARK. 
     # IF I AM NOT WRONG THERE ARE 27 POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS? THEN WRITING IF STATEMENENTS FOR EACH WILL BE VERY TIME CONSUMING.
     # ANY IDEA WHAT TO DO? OR SHALL WE JUST MAKE IT SUCH THAT SIZES CHANGE TOGETHER AND HENCE ONLY HAVE 3 COMBINATIONS AS BELOW?
     # ALSO IMPORTANT, ATM VECTORS AFTER VALUE ARE "AND", WHAT WOULD WE DO IF WE WANTED "OR"? 
     # Wout: GoodGoalMulti 0 and 1 change together, so we only need one of them. This reduces the situation to 3 x 3 = 9 cases.
     # Wout: If some cases result in the same value, maybe you can group some together with !R ranges? If need be we can introduce another notation for a set of as well, e.g. !S [2,10,28]
     # Wout: Also, does this need to be pass_mark instead of pass, or is this some other field?
