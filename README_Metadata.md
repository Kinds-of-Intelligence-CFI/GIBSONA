Metadata file presents the structure of the battery, as described in the Read me_Main. The first columns thus correspond to the following: 
* **Main suites**
* **Sub suites**
* **Object type**
* **Experimental paradigm**
* **Basic tasks** 

Additionally, we bolded the tasks in the *Basic tasks* to indicate which ones in the *Main suites* contain control tasks.

Besides the structure of the battery the metadata contains the following information: 
* **What is measured**: This column briefly describes which *target* capability is measured by a given task.
* **Prerequisite capabilities assumed**: This column lists *all prerequisite* capabilities that are needed in order to complete a given task.
* **Task relevant variations**: This column lists factors that can be manipulated (by our procedural generation tool) and that *should affect the agent’s performance* if the agent possesses the target capability.
